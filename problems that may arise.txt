doPreprocessing:
	Sometimes, flan library crash because of the CellSize parameter of extractHOGFeatures(im,'CellSize',[64 32]) being too small because FLANN ANN needs the same dimension for the two preporcessed datasets. If image dimensions are different then there might arise some problems.

Image Resizing for large image:
	If the sizes of the images are 640*440 or greater than this then to get good result you need to resize the image before extracting the HOG features. I usually resized to 32*32 and has a better performance over the original size.

Error: Improper assignment with rectangular empty matrix.

       dhog(j,:)= d(:);
       It means that the params.dataset(1).cellSize should be smaller. 
       cellSize must be smaller than the image size
